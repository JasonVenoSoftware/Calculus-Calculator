# Calculus-Calculator

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This program was made with the goal of lessening the time it took me to complete my Calculus work.
For example, instead of doing the 27 calculations required to multiply two 3 x 3 martixes, this program does it instantly.  

# What did you do particularly well?
This program is well organized, with different frames representing different tools, and frames within frames for related tools (like areas of different shapes).  

# Where could you enhance your code?
I did not give it proper input validation in a few parts.  Currently the user could make the radius of a circle a negative number or a letter, which crashes the program.

# Did you find writing any part of this code challenging and how did you overcome it?  What tools/resources did you use?
I had the hardest time starting this project, as I did not know how to make different "pop-ups" for each tool.  
After I found tkinter, this project went fairly smoothly, as each tool was its own separate mini-project.  

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to future projects?  
This project taught me a lot about the importance of a user-friendly final product, and the value of organizing a large project for simplicity.
